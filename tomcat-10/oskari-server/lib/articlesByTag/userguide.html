	This user guide contains information about the map window and its functions. In the map window you can compile map views and browse geographic datasets by opening map layers one at a time or several transparent levels on top of one another. You can also embed maps on your own website or share a link with external users. This guide contains information about how the map window works. In addition, the map window offers interactive guidance in various situations.</p>

	<a name="how-to-use-the-map"></a>How to use the map</h3>
<p>
	A map consists of different map layers, which have been made available by the service provider. The first thing you see when you open the map window is the default view. You can delete your map whenever you wish by clicking Restore defaults in Tools at the bottom left and in the centre of the panning controls.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	Basic functions</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Move the map</strong> by clicking and dragging it or by clicking the panning controls in the top right corner. When you are looking for a specific object or location, use the Search function.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Zoom in and out</strong> by clicking the + and - signs next to the scale selector, or click and drag the switch to directly select a specific scale level.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The coordinates </strong>show the location of the mouse pointer on the map.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Index map</strong> shows the map view in a smaller scale. You can show and hide the index map by clicking the right bottom corner of the map window.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Objects </strong>on the map often contain additional information. Click an object on the map to view any additional information. Data products display on a list any objects that are located within the area shown in the map window. You can set conditions to limit your selection to particular kinds of objects in a data product. A list of object information is shown when you click the Object data link to the right of the map.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	Menus</h3>
<p>
	Use the <strong>Search </strong>menu to find a place name and centre the map on that location.</p>
<p>
	Use the <strong> Map layers</strong> menu to search for and select datasets provided by various providers. The datasets have been sorted according to theme and data provider. Datasets:<br /></p>
<p>
	A grey symbol means that the dataset concerned cannot be viewed on the selected scale level. When you select a data product, an Object data link is shown to the right of the map. Click this link to view a list of object data about objects in the area covered by the map.</p>
<p>
	Use the <strong>Selected map layers</strong> menu to see which datasets are currently displayed in the map view. You can adjust the order and transparency of map layers or delete them. A bubble to the right of the menu shows the number of selected map layers.</p>
<p>
	Use the<strong> My information</strong> menu to see all saved <a href="#my-places">M</a><a href="#my-places">y objects</a>, My views (see Tools below) and <a href="#how-to-create-and-embed-a-map-view">the maps you have embedded</a> elsewhere. Here you can also &quot;un-embed&quot; a map. The menu also contains your user information and allows you to change it. You must be logged in to use this function.</p>
<p>
	Use the<strong> Create map</strong> menu to create the code you need to embed the map view you have compiled, which you then can embed on your own website or on a company website. You need to be logged in to use this function.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Map legend</strong> menu contains a description of the symbols used on the map layers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The User guide</strong> menu contains this user guide. If you need more help, the i-symbol or more information link contain additional information.<br />
